### Exercises:

1. Create a Python script that has three variables: ip_addr1, ip_addr2, ip_addr3 (representing three corresponding IP addresses). Print these three variables to standard output using a single print statement.

   Make your print statement compatible with both Python2 and Python3.

   If you are using either Linux or MacOS make your program executable by adding a shebang line and by changing the files permissions (i.e. chmod 755 exercise1.py).

2. Prompt a user to enter in an IP address from standard input. Read the IP address in and break it up into its octets. Print out the octets in decimal, binary, and hex.

   Your program output should look like the following:

       $ python exercise2.py 
       Please enter an IP address: 80.98.100.240
       
            Octet1         Octet2         Octet3         Octet4
        ------------------------------------------------------------
              80             98             100            240
           0b1010000      0b1100010      0b1100100     0b11110000
             0x50           0x62           0x64           0xf0
        ------------------------------------------------------------

   Four columns, fifteen characters wide, a header column, data centered in the column.

3. Create three different variables the first variable should use all lower case characters with underscore ( _ ) as the word separator. The second variable should use all upper case characters with underscore as the word separator. The third variable should use numbers, letters, and underscore, but still be a valid variable Python variable name.

   Make all three variables be strings that refer to IPv6 addresses.

   Use the from future technique so that any string literals in Python2 are unicode.

   - compare if variable1 equals variable2
   - compare if variable1 is not equal to variable3

4. Create a show_version variable that contains the following

       show_version = "*0        CISCO881-SEC-K9       FTX0000038X    " 

   - Remove all leading and trailing whitespace from the string.
   - Split the string and extract the model and serial_number from it.
   - Check if 'Cisco' is contained in the model string (ignore capitalization).
   - Check if '881' is in the model string.
   - Print out both the serial number and the model.

5. You have the following three variables from the arp table of a router:

       mac1 = "Internet  10.220.88.29           94   5254.abbe.5b7b  ARPA   FastEthernet4"
       mac2 = "Internet  10.220.88.30            3   5254.ab71.e119  ARPA   FastEthernet4"
       mac3 = "Internet  10.220.88.32          231   5254.abc7.26aa  ARPA   FastEthernet4"

   Process these ARP entries and print out a table of "IP ADDR" to "MAC ADDRESS" mappings. The output should look like following:

            IP ADDR          MAC ADDRESS
       ------------       --------------
       10.220.88.29       5254.abbe.5b7b
       10.220.88.30       5254.ab71.e119
       10.220.88.32       5254.abc7.26aa

   Two columns, 20 characters wide, data right aligned, a header column.

 - [ ] VII.  Using .join()
 - [ ] VIII. sys.argv
 - [ ] IX.   Linters
 
### Exercises:

1. Open the "show_version.txt" file for reading. Use the .read() method to read in the entire file contents to a variable. Print out the file contents to the screen. Also print out the type of the variable (you should have a string at this point).

   Close the file.

   Open the file a second time using a Python context manager (with statement). Read in the file contents using the .readlines() method. Print out the file contents to the screen. Also print out the type of the variable (you should have a list at this point).

2. Create a list of five IP addresses.

   - Use the .append() method to add an IP address onto the end of the list. Use the .extend() method to add two more IP addresses to the end of the list.
   - Use list concatenation to add two more IP addresses to the end of the list.
   - Print out the entire list of ip addresses. Print out the first IP address in the list. Print out the last IP address in the list.
   - Using the .pop() method to remove the first IP address in the list and the last IP address in the list.
   - Update the new first IP address in the list to be '2.2.2.2'. Print out the new first IP address in the list.

3. Read in the "show_arp.txt" file using the readlines() method. Use a list slice to remove the header line.

   - Use pretty print to print out the resulting list to the screen, syntax is:

       from pprint import pprint
       pprint(some_var)

   - Use the list .sort() method to sort the list based on IP addresses.
   - Create a new list slice that is only the first three ARP entries.
   - Use the .join() method to join these first three ARP entries back together as a single string using the newline character ('\n') as the separator.
   - Write this string containing the three ARP entries out to a file named "arp_entries.txt".

4. Read in the "show_ip_int_brief.txt" file into your program using the .readlines() method.

   - Obtain the list entry associated with the FastEthernet4 interface. You can just hard-code the index at this point since we haven't covered for-loops or regular expressions. Use the string .split() method to obtain both the IP address and the corresponding interface associated with the IP.
   - Create a two element tuple from the result (intf_name, ip_address).
   - Print that tuple to the screen.

   Use pycodestyle on this script. Get the warnings/errors to zero. You might need to 'pip install pycodestyle' on your computer (you should be able to type this from the shell prompt). Alternatively, you can type 'python -m pip install pycodestyle'.

5. Read the 'show_ip_bgp_summ.txt' file into your program. From this BGP output obtain the first and last lines of the output.

   - From the first line use the string .split() method to obtain the local AS number.
   - From the last line use the string .split() method to obtain the BGP peer IP address.
   - Print both local AS number and the BGP peer IP address to the screen.
